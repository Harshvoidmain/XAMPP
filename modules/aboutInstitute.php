		<span class="more">Fr. C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology was established in 1994 in the heart of Navi Mumbai, Vashi, as a part of Agnel Technical Education Complex.The aim of the Institute isto provide quality technical education in addition to inculcating moral values in its students. Apart from academic excellence, the campus is also reputed for its extensive facilities that have led to it being awarded an “A” grade by the Directorate of Technical Education, Maharashtra, right from its inception. The institute is affiliated to the Mumbai University and offers 05 undergraduate engineering programmes (i.e. Computer, Mechanical, Electronics & Telecommunication, Electrical, and Information Technology) and 03 postgraduate engineering programmes (Mechanical, Electronics & Telecommunication, and Electrical). The institute is also a Mumbai University approved Research Centre and hosts research of a number of PhD students in 03 engineering disciplines (i.e. Mechanical, Electronics & Telecommunication, and Electrical). The religious minority status has been granted to the institute and its 5 undergraduate engineering programmes have been accredited by the National Board of Accreditation, India. The institute has, within a short span of time, established itself as a leading engineering college in Mumbai University because of its consistent university ranks and remarkable campus placement. Though its reputation rests mainly on the high quality, value-based technical education that it imparts, it has to its credit an invigorating, well-maintained campus, and comprehensive facilities.<br>

            </div>

        <div class="hmabt2 " style="text-align: justify;">
           <span class="more">It is proposed to organize the 4th IEEE & IAS Technically Co-Sponsored Biennial International Conference on Nascent Technologies in Engineering (ICNTE 2021) using Virtual Mode at Fr. C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Vashi, Navi Mumbai (INDIA). The previous three conferences, ICNTE 2015, ICNTE 2017 and ICNTE 2019, were technically co-sponsored by IEEE. The papers presented in the conferences were published in IEEE Xplore which is a Scopus indexed digital library. ICNTE 2021 offers an occasion to bring together practitioners in the forefront of technologies from different parts of the world to share their research findings. In addition to paper presentations, the conference will also comprise of keynote addresses by experts from leading Institutions, Research Organizations, and Industries. The information disseminated through this technical interaction will introduce the newcomers and knowledge seekers in various engineering fields to the advancements in latest technologies. The present state of technology is the synergy of skills and knowledge from various disciplines. Thus, the deliberations in ICNTE 2021 will emphasize on the thrust areas from the engineering fields of Mechanical, Electronics and Telecommunication, Electrical, Computer, Information Technology and Humanities and Basic Science. Fr. C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology has instituted the Best Paper Award (open to all) and Young Researcher Award (for students) in each track of ICNTE 2021 to appreciate the hard work and dedication of the researchers towards carrying out novel research.</span> </div>
